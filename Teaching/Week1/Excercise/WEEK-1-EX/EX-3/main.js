// EXERCISE 3: Create variables for your first name and last name, then combine them into a full name and print it

// Your code here:
let firstName = "Vorng";
let lastName = "Viseth";
let fullName = firstName + " " + lastName;
console.log(`my full name is ${firstName} ${lastName}`);
console.log(fullName);
